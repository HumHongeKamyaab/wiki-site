#+title: Help Cheatsheet

* Hints to find what you are looking for

Emacs is self documented, the code's documentation is searchable, accessible within emacs.

- functions, commands, variables are usually prefixed by the mode name. For example, org-roam is the prefix for *org-roam*-db-build-cache command.
- All these shortcuts present you with a minibuffer, or a selection prompt (ex: ivy, helm). The user experience really depends on your configuration.
