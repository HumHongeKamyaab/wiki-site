* Desktop Environments and Window Managers

More likely than not, you want to install a window manager or desktop
environment. KDE is /not/ installable on Guix due to numerous issues,
XFCE would be a good alternative to look at.

Quite a few window managers have built in support:
- i3
- EXWM
- dwm
- Xmonad
- StumpWM

There are also desktop environments for those who prefer them:
- XFCE
- GNOME
