#+TITLE: GNU Guix

/A liberating, dependable, and hackable functional OS and package manager./

* Welcome to the System Crafters' Community GNU Guix Wiki!

GNU Guix is a functional, reproducible GNU/Linux package manager and
OS. A free (as in freedom), Guile Scheme based alternative to Nix,
Guix provides the power of a functional OS and more. While powerful,
many of Guix's configurations and options seem arcane and
inaccessible. This wiki is here to show that the complete opposite is
true!

** Why if so many other places (and the manual) exist?

Truthfully, there arenâ€™t that many other places. The System Crafters'
wiki is attempting to enable more people to use GNU Guix with free and
non-free software. The community should understand and be open to the
fact that not all can realistically use only free software; this is
not to say that the FSF is wrong or bad, but that we should ease
people into using free as in freedom software and utilities. The
System Crafters community believes there is a lot we can do to improve
the experience for all.

** Where to start?

If you've never used or heard of GNU Guix, you should start at "FAQs"
<placeholder>. If you've used Nix before, or are feeling courageous,
start right away at "Installation Guide" <placeholder> if you want a
fully free experience, or if you are not sure what that means or want
nonfree (recommended choice), start at the "Nonguix Installation
Guide." <placeholder>
