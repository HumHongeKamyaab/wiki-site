#+TITLE: Code of Conduct

The System Crafters wiki's purpose is to provide extra resources for
tools such as GNU Emacs and GNU Guix that might otherwise be difficult
to understand. This is a community driven effort to organise the
project and write articles.

It is expected that those who contribute do so to improve the
experience for all, and not to harm others. This may include
disrespect, advertising, spamming, and other actions that do not
benefit the wiki.

Please ensure that you think through what you are doing before
following through with it.

Use the [[community/chat-with-us][community communication]] to improve your contribution and to
collaborate with others, as well as the Git repositories.
